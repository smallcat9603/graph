.. index:: what is Pyro

What is Pyro?
-------------
A library that enables you to build applications in which
objects can talk to each other over the network, with minimal programming effort.
You can just use normal Python method calls to call objects running on other machines.
Pyro is a pure Python library and runs on many different platforms and Python versions.

Pyro can be found on Pypi as `Pyro5 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pyro5/>`_.  Source is on Github: https://github.com/irmen/Pyro5

Pyro5 is the current version of Pyro. `Pyro4 <https://pyro4.readthedocs.io/>`_ is the predecessor
that only gets important bugfixes and security fixes, but is otherwise no longer being improved.
New code should use Pyro5 if at all possible.
