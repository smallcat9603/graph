This Jupyter notebook is hosted
https://github.com/neo4j/graph-data-science-client/blob/main/examples/node-regression-with-subgraph-and-graph-sample.ipynb[here]
in the Neo4j Graph Data Science Client Github repository.

For a video presentation on this notebook, see the talk
https://youtu.be/7hx56qtf80Q?t=1759[Fundamentals of Neo4j Graph Data
Science Series 2.x – Pipelines and More] that was given at the NODES
2022 conference.

The notebook exemplifies using a Node Regression pipeline. It also
contains many examples of using

* Convenience objects
* Subgraph projection
* Graph sample projection

It is written in pure Python, to showcase the GDS Python Client’s
ability to abstract away from Cypher queries.

== The dataset

Our input graph represents Wikipedia pages on particular topics, and how
they link to each other:

* Chameleons
* Squirrels
* Crocodiles

The features are presences of certain informative nouns in the text of
the page. The target is the average monthly traffic of the page.

The dataset was first published in _Multi-scale Attributed Node
Embedding_ by B. Rozemberczki, C. Allen and R. Sarkar,
https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13021[eprint 1909.13021]. The version hosted
here was taken from
https://snap.stanford.edu/data/wikipedia-article-networks.html[SNAP] on
2022-11-14.

== Pre-requisites

In order to run this pipeline, you must have the following:

* A running Neo4j DBMS with
** a recent version of Graph Data Science installed
** a recent version of APOC installed

These requirements are satisfied if you have an AuraDS instance active
and running.

== Preparing the dataset for the pipeline

In order to use the dataset, we must prepare the features in a format
that the model supports and can work well with. In their raw form, the
features are ids of particular words, and therefore are not suitable as
input to linear regression.

To overcome this, we will use a one-hot encoding. This will produce
features that work well for linear regression. We begin by learning the
dictionaries of nouns across the node sets. We create a node to host the
dictionary, then we use it to one-hot encode all feature vectors.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# Construct one-hot dictionaries
gds.run_cypher(
    """
    MATCH (s:Chameleon)
    WITH s.features AS features
    UNWIND features AS feature
    WITH feature
      ORDER BY feature ASC

    CREATE (:Feature {animal: 'chameleon', totality: orderedTotality})
    RETURN orderedTotality
"""

== Connectivity

In graph analysis, it is common to operate only over _connected_ graphs.
That is, graphs that consist of only a single _component_. The reason
for this is that in most cases, information does not flow where there
are no connections.

The fastest way to determine the number of components in our graph is to
use the WCC (Weakly Connected Components) algorithm.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# We use the WCC algorithm to see how many components we have
wcc_result = gds.wcc.mutate(G_animals, mutateProperty="wcc_component")

print(wcc_result[["computeMillis", "componentCount"]])
----

== Component separation

Learning that our graph consists of three components, we will next
separate the components into separate graphs. We will use the `subgraph`
projection to accomplish this. We will create one subgraph for each of
the components.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# First, we stream the component ids
components = gds.graph.nodeProperty.stream(G_animals, "wcc_component")

# Second, we compute the unique component ids
component_ids = components["propertyValue"].unique()

# Third, we project a subgraph for each component
component_graphs = [
    gds.beta.graph.project.subgraph(
        f"animals_component_{component_id}",
        G_animals,
        f"n.wcc_component = {component_id}",
        "*",
    )[0]
    for component_id in component_ids
]

# Lastly, we map the node labels in the graphs to the graph
graph_components_by_labels = {str(G_component.node_labels()): G_component for G_component in component_graphs}

print({k: v.name() for k, v in graph_components_by_labels.items()})
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# Now, we are only interested in the Chameleon graph,
# so we will drop the other graphs and define a better variable for the one we keep
graph_components_by_labels[str(["Crocodile"])].drop()
graph_components_by_labels[str(["Squirrel"])].drop()
G_chameleon = graph_components_by_labels[str(["Chameleon"])]
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# With the graph object G_chameleon, we can inspect some statistics
print("#nodes: " + str(G_chameleon.node_count()))
print("#relationships: " + str(G_chameleon.relationship_count()))
print("Degree distribution")
print("=" * 25)
print(G_chameleon.degree_distribution().sort_index())
----

== Now, let’s construct a training pipeline!

We will create a Node Regression pipeline, and then

[arabic]
. configure the splitting
. add model candidates
. configure auto-tuning
. add node property steps
. select model features

The pipeline lives in the Pipeline Catalog, and we are operating it
through the Pipeline object, for maximum convenience.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# Now, let's construct a training pipeline!
chameleons_nr_training = gds.nr_pipe("node_regression_pipeline__Chameleons")

# We configure the splitting

# A linear regression model with the learningRate parameter in a search space
chameleons_nr_training.addLinearRegression(
    penalty=1e-5,

    tolerance=1e-5,
    minEpochs=20,
    maxEpochs=500,
    learningRate={"range": [100, 1000]},  # We let the auto-tuner find a good value
)
# Let's try a few different models
chameleons_nr_training.configureAutoTuning(maxTrials=10)

# Our input feature dimension is 3132
# We can reduce the dimension to speed up training using a FastRP node embedding
chameleons_nr_training.addNodeProperty(

    propertyRatio=0.8,
    featureProperties=["features_one_hot"],

    randomSeed=420,
)

# And finally we select what features the model should be using
# We rely on the FastRP embedding solely, because it encapsulates the one-hot encoded source features
chameleons_nr_training.selectFeatures("frp_embedding")
