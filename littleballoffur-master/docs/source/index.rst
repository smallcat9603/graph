Little Ball of Fur Documentation
==================================

*Little Ball of Fur* consists of methods to do sampling of graph structured data. To put it simply it is a Swiss Army knife for graph sampling tasks. First, it includes a large variety of vertex, edge and expansions sampling techniques. Second, it provides a unified application public interface which makes the application of sampling algorithms trivial for end-users. Implemented methods cover a wide range of networking (`Networking <https://link.springer.com/conference/networking>`_, `INFOCOM <https://infocom2020.ieee-infocom.org/>`_, `SIGCOMM  <http://www.sigcomm.org/>`_) and data mining (`KDD <https://www.kdd.org/kdd2020/>`_, `TKDD <https://dl.acm.org/journal/tkdd>`_, `ICDE <http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/program?id=1331&s=ICDE&f=International%20Conference%20on%20Data%20Engineering>`_) conferences, workshops, and pieces from prominent journals.
